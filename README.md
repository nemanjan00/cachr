## Features

 * [ ] Schedule tasks

 * [ ] Wrapper for cached tasks

 * [ ] Notifications

## Installation

You will need node and npm installed. 

```bash
sudo npm install -g keshr
```

## Usage

### Wrapper

Wrapper can either run command that is not inside your scheduler config and store its output in cache for some time or run the one that is in your config. 

Example: 

```bash
keshr wrapper -c "ls" -t 1h
```

### Scheduler

You can define tasks in ``~/.config/keshr/config.json``

### Daemon

For keshr to work, you need to start daemon first. 

```bash
keshr daemon [-d]
```

Where -d runs it in background. 

## Architecture

### Daemon

What daemon does is runs tasks, holds cache and display notifications.

### Client

Client sends commands to daemon. 

It can be used as command wrapper.
